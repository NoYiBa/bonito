# Bonito

Bonito is (or will be) a web-ui for the [Packetbeat](http://packetbeat.com)
monitoring system.

It is meant to be used as a complementary to Kibana for visualizing the
performance data collected by Packetbeat and indexed in Elasticsearch.

Unlike Kibana, Bonito relies on a given structure for the data and  has a focus
on visualisations for performance management. Like Kibana, it is very
configurable with regards to the specifics of the data, like the field names.
